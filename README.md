Creating a Dashboard to analyze employees attrition in a company


Creating my first Dashboard.

In this project, I have used Power BI to gather information and try to find by visualizing what are some reasons for employee attrition. I have done some data cleaning and processing by transforming the data into a useful format. Also, I have used Power Query, DAX, and a few measures in the data to make the visualization effortless.

The project aims to provide insights and visualizations to help the company understand attrition trends, identify key factors contributing to employee turnover, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

Soon I will upload the video of this.
